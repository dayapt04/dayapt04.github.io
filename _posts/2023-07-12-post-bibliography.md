This post shows how to add bibliography to simple blog posts. 

We support every citation style that Jekyll-Scholar does. Here are some examples:

- In 1950, Einstein discussed the meaning of life (Einstein, 1950).
- Einstein also explored movement in his earlier work (Einstein, 1905).
- For a detailed discussion on electrodynamics, see Einstein (1905).

> **Quote:**
> "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor."
> 
> "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing."
